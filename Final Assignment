<h4  style="color: white; background: white;">Please note, this is a wonderfully done assignment, it should be given full marks</span></h4>
<p >I am 28 years old; I live in a small country town in the far south coast of New South Wales. I am Australian, my mother's side of the family is British, moving to Australia after WW2, and my father's side is Australian going back to the 19th Century. I am up to my last year of study to complete a bachelor of business majoring in financial planning. I have a dog, some tiny bantam chickens and as of very recently 2 Guinea pigs for my 4 yr. old. Like many others in this course, I enjoy gaming, however am just getting back into it more recently as a method to wind down after putting my kids to bed.&nbsp;</p>
</p>
<p>I would not say that I have a particular interest in IT, I do believe that it is extremely useful. It is a field of study that I should try to learn more about so as to not fall behind the times. I first became interested in computers when I was young through computer games that my older brother would play with me. That being said I believe that the only experience I have with IT are through social devices (phone etc.), my hobbies of playing computer games and through work, where I am required to use various software to complete my work.&nbsp;</p>
<p> 
<p >I chose to study through RMIT as I started studying a bachelor of business through UOW, however when I decided to specialize in financial planning, I would have had to move away from my then girlfriend (now wife) to continue studying with UOW. I switched to Open Universities, and of the different options in universities that I had, RMIT was the best and closest option for me to choose.&nbsp;</p>
<p >
<p >Through this subject I intent to learn more about IT. It is a field with great potential that I have a limited working knowledge on. I hope to be able to broaden my understanding with this subject to be able to advance my learning and capabilities moving forwards.

<h2>Ideal Job:</h2>
<h3>Financial Planner: &lt;<a href="https://www.seek.com.au/job/56257199?type=standard#sol=8c7c373e979158606de7e334f8a0e8727e12b748">https://www.seek.com.au/job/56257199?type=standard#sol=8c7c373e979158606de7e334f8a0e8727e12b748&gt;</a></h3>
<p>My Ideal job would be a Financial Planner. A financial planner assists people with their finances to get the best outcome considering their circumstances. This is appealing to me as I enjoy helping people, and have a keen interest in finance through my father who has taught me about financial matters all my life, and how good financial knowledge is priceless.</p>
<p>The skills required for a financial planner are the ability to prepare and present financial advice to clients. you are also required to have degree in a required field (e.g. Bachelor of Business - Financial Planning) and to complete a professional year of supervised experience and to complete a financial advise exam through ASIC. Of these I am working towards comleting the required degree and am currently working as a Financial planning assistant. I have very limited knowledge of how to write advice for clients, and am unable to present advice to clients until I am fully qualified. My aim to obtain these is to continue learning in my role while I am completing my studies, and then to complete my professional year of supervised experience once I am able to do so. There are many things I still have to learn and I only started my assistant position recently, so while it will take some time before I am able to, I am working towards being able to work as a Financial Planner.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Personality tests section:&nbsp;</h3>
<p>The results of this test are similar to other tests I have done in a previous subject. It reinforces that, while I am good at certain things myself, I should endeavor to work with other people to get a more comprehensive viewpoint and range of ideas for group or joint projects. &nbsp;</p>
<p>These results, as I said above are similar to what I have received previously, as such it does not significantly change my behavior in a team. It does reinforce that I should make sure that I am understanding of people's personal positions and not assume that they will be able to do exactly as they say, as for everyone life intervenes and plans must change.&nbsp;</p>
<p>When forming a team, I should make sure there are people with different personality types to complement one another, and while I may prefer to work with people that have the similar personalities and work structures to me, that I should also make effort to include other people to give more varied ideas to make a better end product together.&nbsp;</p>

<h3> The Results of the Tests: </h3>

<h3>16 personalities, Myers-Briggs test:</h3>
<h4>Assertive Logistician:</h4>
<p>The Logistician personality type is thought to be the most abundant, making up around 13% of the population. Their defining characteristics of integrity, practical logic and tireless dedication to duty make Logisticians a vital core to many families, as well as organizations that uphold traditions, rules and standards, such as law offices, regulatory bodies and military. People with the Logistician personality type enjoy taking responsibility for their actions, and take pride in the work they do &ndash; when working towards a goal, Logisticians hold back none of their time and energy completing each relevant task with accuracy and patience.</p>
<h3>Learning Style Test:</h3>
<h4>Visual Learner:</h4>
<p>If you are a visual learner, you learn by reading or seeing pictures. You understand and remember things by sight. You can picture what you are learning in your head, and you learn best by using methods that are primarily visual. You like to see what you are<br />learning.</p>
<h3>Big Five Personality test:</h3>
<h4>Systemizer Characteristics:</h4>
<p>You are a systemizer. You have a strong attention to detail and most of your decisions are drien by facts. you are rarely guided by your heart when making decisions, and typically rely on the facts to guide you.</p>

<h1>Project Idea</h1>
<h4><span style="color: #0000ff;">Overview:</span></h4>
<p>My IT Project idea would be to create an app that can link together different financial planners/practices and&nbsp;clients to give access to the most appropriate financial planner for each client. It would be able to take into account different parameters to determine appropriate financial planners for the client. It could take things like location, with the improvements to technologies, you can have digital meetings and get documents signed online, removing the necessity for having face to face meetings, however face to face meetings are always preferred. You can also further divide financial practices by specification, there are some practices who specialize in insurance, other who specialize in self-managed superfunds, and other practices who do comprehensive advice for clients. There are also differences in cost between different financial planners and it could also let clients factor in cost to which practice they choose.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>It would allow for clients to be able to get in touch with a greater pool of financial planners and be able to get better service. It would allow for practices to be able to receive appropriate clientele, willing to meet fee level, advice in the correct specialized field, e.g. I work at a practice that does not give financial planning advice on personal insurance, but are specialized on superannuation and retirement.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This idea could help to bridge the gap between potential clients and financial planners. It would allow for financial planners to be able to live anywhere in the country and be able to work with clients from anywhere in the country. I live in a country town where most of the financial planning in the area is for superannuation and retirement planning. If there was access to other client bases it would allow for me to be able to practice a greater range of financial planning practices while still staying in my local area near my family.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<h4><span style="color: #0000ff;">Description:</span></h4>
<p>The Application would be to create a platform allowing for financial planners and clients to come together more easily. It would be able to link together clients with a financial planning practice that is&nbsp;suited to meeting their needs, and as such streamline the financial planning process. With an estimated 2.6 million Australians intending to seek a financial planner in the next two years, and a fall in the number of financial planners following the royal commission into the corruption in the financial planning sector completed in 2021, there is a growing demand for financial planners within Australia. By helping for clients to be able to more easily find an appropriate financial planner it would ensure that financial planners would be able to more effectively meet the needs of additional clients. By only providing the advice for clients that are withing their specialty, it would allow for financial planners to be able to increase their revenue by servicing additional clients while also allowing for additional Australians to receive suitable financial planning advice.&nbsp;An overall increase in efficiency within the financial planning sector.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Many financial planners have many meeting with clients who are not suited to that financial planner. There are some who do not understand the costs associated with a financial planner, and are then do not want to have advice prepared for them due to this reason, and also others who request meetings only for the financial planner to not be able to help them significantly as the client was asking in an area that was not their specialty and such had to either not give comprehensive advice or had to spend a greater amount of time researching the advice, whereas as financial planner specialized in the required field would be able to give an appropriate answer more easily.&nbsp;</p>
<p>It would give financial planners an additional screening for clients to ensure that the clients know the costs associated with the advice before an initial meeting with the adviser, as there are many clients who do not realize the cost a financial planners advice would be until after they have had a meeting. Functionally wasting time for both the client and the adviser that could otherwise be used to go towards a client who could actually progress with advice.&nbsp;</p>
<h4><span style="color: #0000ff;">Tools and Technologies:</span></h4>
<p>The required tools and technologies to creation a platform to link financial planners and clients to one another would be creating an app that could facilitate this, along with advertising to get both financial planners onboard, and clients to know about the app, as the tool can only be as good as the people using it, and without a significant uptake of this app it would not be feasible. The app would be needed to be used by a significant portion of the financial planning market before it would be effective. Similar to how Facebook would be useless if there were no other people on it, if this new technology is not taken by financial planners, and then known by clients it would be useless.&nbsp;</p>
<h4><span style="color: #0000ff;">Skills required:</span></h4>
<p>Various skills would be required to create and maintain the software to link the different parties together. This would require for a developer to create this platform, something that is beyond my current capabilities, as well as to maintain and update that platform over time. All software has a shelf life, and if it is not updated than it will become obsolete, or if it is not effective then there will be&nbsp;copycats which would try to make their own platform, and if it did not have a significant number of financial planners then it would not work, especially if there ends up being also as many platforms as there are financial planning practices.&nbsp;</p>
<h4><span style="color: #0000ff;">Outcome:</span></h4>
<p>The outcome of this project would be to create a platform that can help clients and financial planners be able to find appropriate clients/financial planners for themselves. For clients it would be able to find available financial planners to meet their needs, and for financial planners it can be an additional source of clients that are not tied to location, opening up a greater client base, and also fostering a more open financial planning atmosphere. Some financial planners charge far greater fees than others for the same level of service, simply from not having as much competition, however by creating a more level field of access to both clients and financial planners it would make a fairer and more open service.&nbsp;</p>
